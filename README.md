# LOAN-PREDICTOR

This project is intended to predict whether or not the

This project can be used with python to gain insights into Data Analytics.
This project involves certain steps of preprocessing, validation etc. that are usually performed in ML.

Here are the algorithms that I used:

1. Naive Bayes
2.Logistic Regression
